                            <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it
                                doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,
                                beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a
                                workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to
                                work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p> <br>
                            <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
                                *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and
                                companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own
                                workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
                                impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p> <br>

                                well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to
                                put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow
                                them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements
                                that together comprise a well-told story.</p> <br>

                                such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re
